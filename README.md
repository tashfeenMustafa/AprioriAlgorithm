# Apriori Algorithm Implementation in Python - Data Science/Data Mining
This is an implementation of the Apriori Algorithm in Python. It is commonly used in Data Mining to mine frequent itemsets from transactional databases.

Data Repository: http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/

Experiment on the following datasets:

- Mushroom
- Chess
- Retail
- Pumsb

I have also included the text output of the frequent itemsets found from each dataset.

This algorithm takes input the minimum support (min_sup) and the name of the dataset under consideration and returns the average transaction length and the number of transactions in total along with a text file of all the frequent itemsets in the dataset.
